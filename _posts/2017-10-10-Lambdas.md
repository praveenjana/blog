**Lambda Expressions:**  

We can see lambda expression as a concise representation of an anonymous function that can be passed around; it doesn’t have a name, but it has a list of parameters, a body, a return type, and also possibly a list of exceptions that can be thrown.

Lets break this definition into following pieces

**Anonymous** We say anonymous because it doesn’t have an explicit name like a method would normally have.

**Function** We say function because a lambda isn’t associated with a particular class like a method is. But like a method, a lambda has a list of parameters, a body, a return type, and a possible list of exceptions that can be thrown.

**Passed around** A lambda expression can be passed as argument to a method or stored in a variable.

**Concise** You don’t need to write a lot of boilerplate like you do for anonymous classes.

**Sample Use case:**

Lets assume you have list employees as shown below.  
 
{% highlight java %}
package com.praveenjana;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Comparator;
import java.util.List;
 
/**

 */
 public class Employee{
    privateint id;
    privateint salary;
    private String name;
 
    public Employee(int id, String name, int salary){
        this.id = id;
        this.salary = salary;
        this.name = name;
    }
 
    public int getId(){
        return id;
    }
 
    public void setId(int id){
        this.id = id;
    }
 
    public int getSalary(){
        return salary;
    }
 
    public void setSalary(int salary){
        this.salary = salary;
    }
 
    public String getName(){
        return name;
    }
 
    public void setName(String name){
        this.name = name;
    }
 
    @Override
    public String toString(){
        return id+" "+name+" "+salary;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args){
        List<Employee> employeeList= new ArrayList<>();
        employeeList.add(new Employee(1, "Praveen", 123));
        employeeList.add(new Employee(2, "Aseer", 1234));
        employeeList.add(new Employee(3, "Ravi", 12345));
        System.out.println("***********Before Sort***************");
        for(Employee e: employeeList)
            System.out.println(e);
        System.out.println("***********After Sort***************");
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now you would like to sort the employeeList by name. We will see the implementation of sort using Collections.Sort() method with and without lambda expressions.

**Without Lambda Expression:**. 

{% highlight java %}

Comparator<Employee> byName = new Comparator<Employee>() {

            @Override
            publicintcompare(Employee o1, Employee o2) {
                return o1.getName().compareTo(o2.getName());
            }
        };
Collections.sort(employeeList, byName);
for(Employee e: employeeList)
            System.out.println(e); 
{% endhighlight %}
In the above code block we are passing byName object (implemented using anonymous class) to the Collections.Sort() method. The code is less flexible and not clearer because of the anonymous class implementation.

**With Lambda Expression:**  

{% highlight java %}
Comparator<Employee> byName = (Employee e1,Employee e2)-> e1.getName().compareTo(e2.getName());

Collections.sort(employeeList, byName);

for(Employee e: employeeList)
     System.out.println(e);
 System.out.println(e);   
{% endhighlight %}
In the above code block we are passing byName object not by Anonymous class implementation but by using Lambda expressions. You are literally passing the code that is really needed to compare two Employees by their name. Don’t worry if all the parts of the lambda expression doesn’t make sens yet. I will explain all the pieces soon.

 Let’s see the syntax for the Lambda expressions.

**Syntax**

(list ofarguments.../Signature) -> {statements/expressions} 

**Few Example Lambda Expressions:**  

{% highlight java %}
(String s) -> s.length() //Accepts String and returns an integer. Here Return type is implicit
 
 
(Employee e) -> e.getSalary()>1234//Lambda accepts an employee and returns Boolean [in this case whether the employee salary is higher than 1234]
 
 
(int x,int y) -> {System.out.println("Output is:");
 
System.out.println(x*y);
 
} //Lambda Accepts two parameters of type and has no return type.  
{% endhighlight %}

**Type inference:** 

In the Lambda expression there is no need to specify the type in the lambda signature. Java Compiler will deduce the type for you.

So, the Simplified version of employeeList sort using Lambda expression shown below.  

{% highlight java %}
Comparator<Employee> byName = (e1,e2)-> e1.getName().compareTo(e2.getName());
Collections.sort(employeeList, byName);
for(Employee e: employeeList)
     System.out.println(e);  
{% endhighlight %}
If there is only one argument in the Signature then you can omit the parentheses.

Hope this article gave an outline of Lambda expressions
